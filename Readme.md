### What is this?

Delegation Poker is a webapp to collaboratively use the [delegation poker](https://t2informatik.de/wissen-kompakt/delegation-poker/) methodology.

> Use Delegation Poker to clarify who’s responsible for what and to what level. This is a method where you can encourage employee engagement through controlled self-organization and clarified value and decision-making.
>
> The objective of Delegation Poker is to drive home the idea of delegating decisions and tasks to your team within a controlled environment. It also is a good collaboration game. Many teams play it without even totaling points and more than anything else it’s a conversation topic and a starting point for the discussion of who should do what.
